# SKILL-DEVELOPMENT-TRAINING-FOR-UNEMPLOYED-YOUTHS

//POBLEM STATMENT FROM HACATHON 2022//

"Challenges has been faced in lntroduction of Govt aligned Skill Development courses in our training calendar.
Better Handholding platform is necessary. On the communication front: Reaching out to the unemployed youths or candidates 
(Either who have been trained or future candidates) has been an humungous task always as there has been always a challenge of maintaining a secured & robust database. 
Sharing information also has been too challenging due to requirement of one to one communication with each and every candidate. 
We are developing a system to be incorporated in our Website / Web Porta'l. In this portal Government can upload the course as well as take live classes. 
which will have dedicated registration feature for the candidates as well as user-interactive triendly features Whattâ€™sapp.
